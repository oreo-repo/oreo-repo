### Thanks for visiting me! ðŸ˜¸

I'm one of those people who you'd just find sitting on litteraly anything and coding with a laptop. I also have a YouTube channel that will soon have tons of videos of me destroying software and fixing it! Also I know coding languages based on C (C++, Swift, Python, you know, all o' them)
