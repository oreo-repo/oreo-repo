### Thanks for visiting me! ðŸ˜¸

I'm one of those people who you'd just find sitting on litteraly anything and coding with a laptop. I also have a YouTube channel that will soon have tons of videos of me destroying software and fixing it! Also I know coding languages based on C (C++, Swift, Python, you know, all o' them)

## What I use to code

I'm just one of those people who don't go installing visual studio on 64GB of storage... (Even though I have 256GB) I'd rather waste my storage and money on Visual Studio for Windows 11! It's a lot easier to edit and markup code with! And it takes about a gigabyte of storage! I am only one person so I am hoping to get a big audience! I also am making a lot of projects so yeah...

## My computer

I have a pretty fine computer. It does what I need it to do, and thats all I care. (Kind of...) I'm looking to get a good Rasberry Pi 5 when it comes out, (not sure if it will lol)  because I need an always on, file server! Other than that, look at my website repository... and that's all I'm gonna share.
